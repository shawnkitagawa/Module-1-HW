# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to have a deeper understanding of the Theater campaign outcomes for the kickstarters based on launch date and also Goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges
Visualized the campaign outcomes of the kickstarter by launch date using a pivot table and graphing. It was challenging to create a pivot tables and graphing since it is my first time but, I am still able to manage to succefully visualize the data using those tools. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The pivot tables and the graph shows that starting from March, the rate of success for the Theater campaign outcomes gradually increases and hits a maximum on May. After that, it gradually decreases until December. The number of failed has a simillar trend as the number of success however, overall the number of success has more count of outcomes compare to number of failed. 


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The pivot tables and the graph shows that goal less than 1000 has the maximum success rate and as the price of the goal increases, the success rate gradually decreases in general. At one point at goal 30000 to 39999 increases the rate of success until 35000 to 39999 but the success rate got steady until goal 40000 to 44999 and decreases its rate and immidietly droped zero percent at goal 45000 to 49999. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Remembering the forumulas was challenging since I never rememberd any formulas. It was also challenging manaually filtering by typing in the cells. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Those graphs tell that starting a theater campaign on around May is the best timing to start since May has the maximum success compare to other months. The outcomes Based on Launch date graph also shows that the worst timing to start a campaign is on December. It has the minimum success and has almost the same amount of failed compare to success. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The outcome based goal suggest that goal less than 1000 has the highest success rate compare to other goals. If Louis is looking for a goal that is more than 1000, the graph reccomends a goal of 35000 to 44999. This range has a success rate over 60 percent, which is the second highest success rate in the data. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The limitaion of the data set is that it is a sample. It is not a population data, which has lack of accuracy. For example, when looking at the outcome based on Goal line chart, it tells that the second highest success rate of this graph is at 35000 to 44999. However, it is hard to explain just from the data the reason why this happend. Maybe this is just an exception that occured. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
It will be better if I could create a percentage based graph for the Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date to show, which month has the highest chance of getting success campaign outcome. It would be easier for Louis to chose the month of when she will start the campaign.
